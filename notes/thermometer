555 timer
---------

\$f=\frac{1}{\ln(2)\cdot{C_1}\cdot(2R_1+R_2)}\$

\$C_1\$ is the capacitor of 4.7 µF, \$R_1\$ is the thermistor and \$R_2\$ is
the resistor (measured to 2.14 kohm) between the discharge pin and VDD.


Beta equation
-------------

\$R=R_0\cdot{e^{-\beta(\frac{1}{T_0}-\frac{1}{T})}}\$

\$T_0\$ is the specified temperature at which \$R = R_0\$ (25°C in this case).
\$R_0\$ is the specified resistance (10 kohm in this case).

\$\beta\$ is 3470 for the thermistor in question.

Steinhart-Hart
--------------

This is supposedly a more accurate approximation of NTC thermistors than the
beta equation.

\$\frac{1}{T}=A+B\cdot{\ln(R)}+C\cdot{\ln(R)^3}\$

\$A\$, \$B\$ and \$C\$ are the constants that define the curve.


Calibration
-----------

The relog daemon uses the Steinhart-Hart equation.  This requires running the
calibration tool to retrieve the \$A\$, \$B\$ and \$C\$ constants for the
thermistor and also \$C_1\$ if you don't happen to have a capacitance meter.

The constants are retrieved using a least-squares regression on actual
measurements.  It's a nasty equation to do it with algebra, a simpler solution
is to do it numerically by constantly making small adjustments on all the
parameters.

The numerical method requires initial values:

- The initial value of \$C_1\$ should be the specified capacitance.

- \$A=\frac{1}{T_0}-\frac{1}{\beta}\ln(R_0)\$ and \$B=\frac{1}{\beta}\$
  where \$T_0\$, \$R_0\$ and \$\beta\$ are specified in the datasheet for
  the thermistor.  (25°C, 10 kohm and 3470)

- \$C\$ is very small compared to \$A\$ and \$B\$, but for the calibration
  script to work, it must have a positive value.  I selected it by trial
  and error.
