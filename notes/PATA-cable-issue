Modern PATA cables (those that contain 80 wires) have several pins shorted to
a ground and some connectors even have a few pins disconnected.

The 40 other wires are the grounds isolating the signals from each other,
they are connected to something that resembles a sawblade. The sawblade has
a few springs that short out to various pins.


To fix the issue, remove the connectors from the cable and remove the blade
from the connectors.

Wires from the cable can be pushed back into the teeth using a small knife.
